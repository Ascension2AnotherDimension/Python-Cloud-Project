Would you like me to update this file in your repo for you or export it to use locally? Also, want to start coding one of the automation features now—like instance management or log parsing?

The name of your project is:

Ascension2AnotherDimension
Pretty badass name, by the way—it gives off sci-fi meets sysadmin wizard vibes 🔮💻

Let me know if you want to add a short tagline or slogan under it, like:

"A Python-powered cloud automation tool for ascending your infrastructure to the next dimension."

Or if you’re thinking of rebranding or adjusting the name, I’m down to help brainstorm too.
